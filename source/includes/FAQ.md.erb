## What is a Mango account?

In Mango, each user can have multiple isolated sub accounts all owned by their PublicKey. 
These accounts are referred to as Mango accounts, and the accounting for their deposits, borrows, and open positions is done independently of other Mango accounts.
If you're not sure which mango account you want to access, or it is your first time using Mango, use '0' for the mangoAccountNumber. 
To read more about Mango accounts take a look at [Mango's documentation] (https://docs.mango.markets/development-resources/mango-client-api#mango-accounts)
The easiest way to fetch Mango accounts for a user is to use the [Mango client] (https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/mango-client-v3/blob/e2d0d67b63f943b6dbf7cc40e6e06c6986f2aa1c/src/client.ts#L1726)
